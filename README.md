# Project: Lane Dodger - Android Course Part 1

## Course Context

Welcome! This project represents **Part 1** of an Android App Development course. It serves as a foundational exercise focusing on core game mechanics, user input, and basic game state management within the Android framework.

## Game Description 🚗💨

Lane Dodger is a simple mobile game where the player controls a car moving along a three-lane road. The objective is to **dodge incoming obstacles** by switching lanes.

**Gameplay:**

* The player's car moves continuously forward.
* Players can swipe or tap to move the car between the **three available lanes**.
* Obstacles appear randomly in the lanes and move towards the player.
* The goal is to survive as long as possible by avoiding collisions.

---

## Current Features ✨

* **Endless Runner:** The game currently runs indefinitely.
* **Basic Movement:** Player control to switch between 3 lanes is implemented.
* **Obstacle Spawning:** Obstacles appear in the lanes.
* **Collision Detection:** The game detects and tracks when the player's car hits an obstacle. *(Note: While collisions are tracked, specific consequences like 'Game Over' might be implemented in later parts of the course).*

## Work In Progress (WIP) 🚧

This is an early version, and many aspects are still under development, particularly the visual design. Items currently considered WIP include:

* 🎨 **Button Design:** Colors, shapes, and styles of UI buttons.
* 🚗 **Car Image:** Placeholder or basic graphic used for the player's car.
* 🧱 **Obstacle Images:** Placeholder or basic graphics for obstacles.
* 🖼️ **Background Image(s):** The visual backdrop for the road and environment.
* ✨ **General UI/UX:** Overall look, feel, and user experience refinement.

Future parts of the course will likely build upon this foundation, adding features like scoring, game over states, improved graphics, and sound.
